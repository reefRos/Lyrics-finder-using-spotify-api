To run the program open both python files and run lyricsFinderInterface.py

Inorder to get the info to link your spotify account and to the genius api you need to connect to both of them.
for the potify credentials just go to google and type "spotify api" or go to this link - https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
after that just connect to your spotify account and go to "DASHBOARD" (should be on the top bar).
under "DASHBOARD" you can create a new app, go ahed and create one. after you created it just click on it and it will send you to an overview,where
you can see two fields: "Client ID" and "Client SECRET" (you might need to press on the "SHOW CLIENT SECRET"). save both of those.

after this go again to google and look for genius api or go to this link - https://docs.genius.com/
after that press "Manage clients" on the left scroll menu (you might need to connect to the site. either create an account or use your google\facebook account).
after you click "Manage clients" and you are connected with an account you'll see a "Generate Access Token" button. press it and copy the token.

when you open the program you'll need to enter the information above inorder to connect it to your spotify account for the current song and to the genius api
for the lyrics database.

make sure to not share your spotify secret key as.. well... its supposed to be secret.
